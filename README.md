## Introduction
Welcome to my project repository! In this project, I explore the impact of alternative energy adoption on CO2 emissions. The goal is to analyze global trends and patterns to understand how the adoption of alternative fuels can contribute to reducing carbon emissions.

## Project Goal/Objective
The main objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between alternative energy adoption and CO2 emissions. By analyzing historical data, we aim to uncover insights that highlight the potential of alternative energy sources in combating climate change.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes data from reputable sources such as the IEA and the World Bank. These datasets provide information on alternative energy adoption rates and CO2 emissions across different countries and regions.

- [World Bank Environmental Data](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/themes/environment.html): This portal offers a wide range of environmental data, including alternative energy adoption percentages and CO2 emissions per capita for various countries.
- [World Bank Economic Data](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/themes/economy.html): This portal provides comprehensive economic indicators, such as Gross National Income (GNI), which are crucial for analyzing the relationship between income levels and alternative energy adoption.
- [IEA Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-energy-highlights): The International Energy Agency provides in-depth insights into greenhouse gas emissions from traditional energy sources, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact.

## Project Scope
This project focuses on analyzing the correlation between alternative energy adoption and CO2 emissions on a global scale. The analysis aims to identify trends, anomalies, and potential factors driving the relationship between these two variables.

## Methods and Tools
The analysis is conducted using Python programming language, with the help of libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Jupyter notebooks were used to perform data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Analysis and Findings
During the analysis, we observed a significant correlation between higher alternative energy adoption rates and lower CO2 emissions. Visualizations showcased a clear trend, indicating the positive impact of embracing alternative energy sources on reducing carbon emissions.

## Future Work
Future work could involve exploring regional variations in the relationship between alternative energy and CO2 emissions. Additionally, delving deeper into the socio-economic factors influencing adoption rates could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the observed trends.

## Conclusion
The project highlights the crucial role of alternative energy adoption in mitigating climate change. By analyzing global data, we have shown that countries with higher alternative energy adoption tend to have lower CO2 emissions. This insight underscores the importance of transitioning to sustainable energy sources for a greener future.

## Getting Started
